## LibDriver HDC1080

[![MISRA](https://img.shields.io/badge/misra-compliant-brightgreen.svg)](/misra/README.md) [![API](https://img.shields.io/badge/api-reference-blue.svg)](https://www.libdriver.com/docs/hdc1080/index.html) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](/LICENSE)

The HDC1080 is a digital humidity sensor with integrated temperature sensor that provides excellent measurement accuracy at very low power. The HDC1080 operates over a wide supply range, and is a low cost, low power alternative to competitive solutions in a wide range of common applications. The humidity and temperature sensors are factory calibrated.

LibDriver HDC1080 is a full-featured driver of HDC1080 launched by LibDriver.It provides the function of reading temperature and relative humidity. LibDriver is MISRA compliant.

/interface includes LibDriver HDC1080 IIC platform independent template.

/test includes LibDriver HDC1080 driver test code and this code can test the chip necessary function simply.

/example includes LibDriver HDC1080 sample code.

/doc includes LibDriver HDC1080 offline document.

/datasheet includes HDC1080 datasheet.

/project includes the common Linux and MCU development board sample code. All projects use the shell script to debug the driver and the detail instruction can be found in each project's README.md.

/misra includes the LibDriver MISRA code scanning results.

### Install

Reference /interface IIC platform independent template and finish your platform IIC driver.

Add the /src directory, the interface driver for your platform, and your own drivers to your project, if you want to use the default example drivers, add the /example directory to your project.

### Usage

You can refer to the examples in the /example directory to complete your own driver. If you want to use the default programming examples, here's how to use them.

#### example basic

```C
#include "driver_hdc1080_basic.h"

uint8_t res;
uint32_t i;
float temperature;
float humidity;

/* basic init */
res = hdc1080_basic_init();
if (res != 0)
{
    return 1;
}

...
    
/* loop */
for (i = 0; i < times; i++)
{
    /* delay 2000ms */
    hdc1080_interface_delay_ms(2000);

    /* read data */
    res = hdc1080_basic_read((float *)&temperature, (float *)&humidity);
    if (res != 0)
    {
        (void)hdc1080_basic_deinit();

        return 1;
    }

    /* output */
    hdc1080_interface_debug_print("hdc1080: %d/%d.\n", (uint32_t)(i + 1), (uint32_t)times);
    hdc1080_interface_debug_print("hdc1080: temperature is %0.2fC.\n", temperature);
    hdc1080_interface_debug_print("hdc1080: humidity is %0.2f%%.\n", humidity); 
    
    ...
}

...
    
/* deinit */
(void)hdc1080_basic_deinit();

return 0;
```
